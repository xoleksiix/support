# Files and  folders

### .github/workflows
- GitHub Actions settings for a repository.

### /authentication
- authentication application, models and API for work with users(sing up/in/out).
    - /migrations - migrations uses to create/update tables for apps.
    - admin.py - file is used to display your models in the Django admin panel.
    - models.py -  is the built-in feature that Django uses to create tables, their fields, and various constraints.
    - apps.py - created to help the user include any application configuration for the app.

### /config
- basic project settings:
	- asgi.py - Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface config for config project.
	- settings.py - a core file in Django projects. It holds all the configuration values web app needs to work; database settings, logging configuration, where to find static files/etc.
    - urls.py - define the mapping between URLs and views.
    - wsgi.py - Web Server Gateway Interface config for config project.

### /core

    - admin.py - file is used to display your models in the Django admin panel.
    - models.py - is the built-in feature that Django uses to create tables, their fields, and various constraints.
    - apps.py - created to help the user include any application configuration for the app.

### /docs

### .gitignore 
- file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
### .pre-commit-config.yaml 
- describes what repositories and hooks are installed.
### Pipfile 
- intended to specify packages requirements for your Python application or library, both to development and execution.
